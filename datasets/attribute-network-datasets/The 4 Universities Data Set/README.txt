This data set contains WWW-pages collected from computer science departments of various universities in January 1997 by the World Wide Knowledge Base (Web->Kb) project of the CMU text learning group. The 8,282 pages were manually classified into the following categories:
student (1641)
faculty (1124)
staff (137)
department (182)
course (930)
project (504)
other (3764)
The class other is a collection of pages that were not deemed the ``main page'' representing an instance of the previous six classes. (For example, a particular faculty member may be represented by home page, a publications list, a vitae and several research interests pages. Only the faculty member's home page was placed in the faculty class. The publications list, vitae and research interests pages were all placed in the other category.)
For each class the data set contains pages from the four universities

Cornell (867)
Texas (827)
Washington (1205)
Wisconsin (1263)
and 4,120 miscellaneous pages collected from other universities.
